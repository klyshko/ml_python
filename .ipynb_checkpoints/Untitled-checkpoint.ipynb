    "This lecture was created as part of a CPS Teaching Fellowship. We are introducing a novel approach to study advanced scientific programming. The goal of today's lecture is to present Machine Learning approach. We will learn about the most typical machine learning problems, such as dimensionality reduction and classification, and how to approach these using the Python programmming language. We will also consider how ML can be used in computational biophsyics using the example from lecture #7. These are the important concepts that we will cover:\n",
